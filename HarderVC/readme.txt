This CLEO script increases the game's difficulty by altering the following:

* Maximum HP is 50
* Maximum Armor is 100
* No more fireproof ability, infinite run and fast reload
* When not on mission, way more increased sensitivity to crime (takes much less aggression to increase your wanted level)
* Certain heavy weapons are unusable for the player and when acquired, they will be replaced to the following weapons:
	- PSG-1 => Sniper Rifle
	- Minigun => Flame Thrower
	- M4 => Kruger
	- MP5 => Uzi
	- Spas12 => Shotgun
	- Rocket Launcher => M60
* When not on a mission, ammo limitation is now a thing (making the game harder until you reach 100%):

	- Colt 45 limited to 65
	- Python is limited to 30
